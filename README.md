## What is XIV Blogs?
XIV Blogs (or XIVB) is a blogging platform for people who play the MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV. It features user profiles that pull information from the [XIVDB](http://xivdb.com/) API to get stats on your in-game characters which you can then make posts and comments as if you like to roleplay.
